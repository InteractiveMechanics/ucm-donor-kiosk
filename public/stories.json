At age 11, Levine, AM'05, a pediatric social worker, was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that can be both painful and debilitating, and sometimes may lead tolife-threatening complications. As a teenager, she transferred care to the University of Chicago Medicine and at that time became one of the youngest patients of Stephen Hanauer, MD, a world leader in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. Inspired by the care she received, her experience as a neonatal intensive care social worker, and her involvement as a volunteer social worker for children with Crohn’s, Levine two years ago established the first pediatric gastrointestinal (GI) family support fund at the medical center."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","text":"To raise money for the fund, Levine hosts an annual bowl-a-thon, which has generated more than $10,000 to support bus fare, parking, food, and educational materials for needy families of patients at the University of Chicago Medicine Comer Children’s Hospital."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","text":"Levine’s goal is to make the pediatric GI family support fund at the University of Chicago Medicine self-sustaining.
